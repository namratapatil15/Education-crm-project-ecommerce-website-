🕰️ Existing System (Before This Project)
Traditional systems lacked a centralized platform for educational communication and student management. Processes were fragmented, manual, and lacked proper tracking. Important data was often lost or stored in multiple, disjointed systems. There was no structure to manage leads, track conversations, or securely handle feedback and reports.

Our CRM system replaces this outdated setup with a centralized, role-based, and scalable web application.
